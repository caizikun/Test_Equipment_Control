# Test_Equipment_Control
Controlling Various Lab Test Equipment



TODO List
 - finish adding ICA: smooth data before analysis
 - create auto-recognizing equipment profiles
 - change charge and discharge to have the psu or eload passed in to the function
 - add multiple end conditions (time, current, voltage) to each step
 - charge/discharge profiles from a file
     - HPPC test profile
 - Add ability to choose different measurement equipment (e.g. DMM instead of eload or PSU for voltage).
