TODO List
 - finish adding ICA: smooth data before analysis
 - create auto-recognizing equipment profiles
     - reads the "IDN?" response and chooses which set up commands to use
 - change charge and discharge to have the psu or eload passed in to the function
 - add multiple end conditions (time, current, voltage) to each step
